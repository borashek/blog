            Interchangeable Knitting Needles
            These are available in the same sizes as fixed circulars. Unlike them, you must screw or
            snap the parts together, then lock the interchangeables in place.

            While commonly sold in sets, you can also purchase them in pairs. I find this feature
            to be quite handy. If you’re also a knitter with too many WIPs and UFOs, then you know what
            it’s like to suffer a shortage of needles. To remedy this, I have duplicates in my most
            used sizes to offset this conundrum.

            Compared to fixed circulars, interchangeables are generally more preferred. Why? I’m glad you asked.

            WHY ARE INTERCHANGEABLE CIRCULAR KNITTING NEEDLES PREFERRED?
            Cord length is adjustable (shortened or lengthened) in progress.
            Needle tip sizes are adjustable in progress.
            Able to vary needle sizes.
            Come in a handy case for protection, quick access, and travel.
            Joining cable prevents lost or dropped needles.
            Can be used to knit flat or in the round.
            Allow you to knit a wide range of project sizes.
            You can lock your work in place if you need to use your knitting needles for another project.
            Great for large projects as they distribute the weight evenly.
            Some brands provide a lifeline built in to the cable.
            Some brands provide cables that spin and/or are kink-free
            WHAT CAN YOU MAKE WITH CIRCULAR KNITTING NEEDLES?
            Some examples of projects knit with circular needles are:

            Hats and headbands
            Gloves and mittens
            Cowls or infinity scarves
            Sweaters
            Amigurumi toys
            Blankets
            Shawls
            Compared to DPNs, these knitting needles allow for knitting in the round on a larger scale.
            Also, fixed and interchangeables are great for large projects designed for flat knitting.
            Overall, they provide more flexibility in your knitting.
